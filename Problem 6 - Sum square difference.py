This program determines the difference between (the sum of (each number between one and one hundred, squared)) and (the square product of (the sum of each number between one and one hundred)).

This seems like a nearly useless mathematical question, so I just made it a little script. Would be interested in knowing if problem 6 had any interesting applications I missed.

"The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum."
